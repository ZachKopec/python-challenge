The scripts found in the PyBank & PyPoll folders produce an analysis for their respective datasets found in the resource folders.
PyBank data is looped through each row to make calculations such as the total, average change, greatest increase in profits and greatest decrease in profits.
These results are then printed to the terminal and written to a text file in the Analysis folder.
PyPoll data is retrived and produced very similarly.
Voting data is analyzed by looping through the rows and counting how many votes each candidate recieve.
Totals as well as percentages for these figures are included.
